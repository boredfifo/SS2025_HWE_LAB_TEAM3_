In this part of the Lab you will connect all of your sensor nodes and actuator nodes
(Arduino Uno Wifi Rev 2, ESP32, smartphone app, etc.) as MQTT Clients for sending
your sensor Data to a MQTT Broker as publisher and receiving on actuator side as
subscriber.
Hint: Use the sensors and actuators from your project
