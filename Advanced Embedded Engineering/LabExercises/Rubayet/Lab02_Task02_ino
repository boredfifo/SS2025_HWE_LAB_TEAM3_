In this slide you should experiment with the Bluetooth Low Energy
interface if your Arduino Wifi.
To do that.
• Download the BLE library Arduino BLE
• Add 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow and Green) to your Arduino design.
• Use the Bluetooth Smartphone App „Lightblue“ to control your LEDs
using BLE
• What about your sensors?
